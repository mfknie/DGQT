# Derivatives Group Quant Trading Website
I have created a basic html document with the basic framework for the website. Everything is local right now. 
The php that is supposed to run the contacts section requires installation of Apache or some shit idk.

TODO list:
*Fix mobile version of site (Need to double check that everything), replace navigation bar with dropdown menu
*Fix the contacts section (or replace with just contact information) 
*Replace the ugly Google calendar with something else (might learn react)
