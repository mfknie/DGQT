        <p id = "missionText"> We are an RSO focused on financial markets and derivatives, and we are excited to have our first prospective class this Spring Quarter.
                Throughout the quarter, our RSO will provide a comprehensive overview on financial derivatives. Furthermore alumni, employers, and professors will speak about their involvement with financial markets and derivatives. As we are growing our RSO, there will be many opportunities to take on greater responsibility within the organization.
                We look forward to having you join us!</p>
